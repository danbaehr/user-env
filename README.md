To install this user environment, simply do:

* make install

This will overwrite your ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_login, and
~/.bash_logout files, so be sure to back them up first.

It will then transfer all the files into ~/.user-env

To remove the installation, just restore these files to their original versions:
* ~/.bashrc 
* ~/.bash_login 
* ~/.bash_logout
   
Then do:

* make clean
